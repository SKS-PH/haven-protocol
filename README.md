## What is a _Haven_?

A _haven_ is a space where content creators can interact with their fans in a much  
more intimate way similar to Web2 services like Patreon, Onlyfans, Fansly, etc.

A _haven_ space improves upon these by eliminating platform risk and allowing  
_haven owners_ have a customized and personalized feel to their space.

A _haven owner_ shouldn't feel like she is using a service or a brand like Patreon/Onlyfans.
